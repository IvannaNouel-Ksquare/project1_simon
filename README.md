| ---------------- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| As a user, I need to see an interface resembling the Simon Says game with 4 quadrants each with differents colors and they should be clickable, this needs to be perfectly centered and have enough space between each quadrant. |  X   |      |      |      |  
| As a user, I need to see a button properly placed so I can start a match. |  X   |      |      |      |
| As a user, after I press start game, I need to be presented with a series of randoms input (only 1 at the start) if I input the pattern correctly it needs to repeat over again but with 1 additional step. |      |   X  |      |      |
| As a user, when the sequence plays or the button is pressed I need to hear a sound for each button. |      |      |   X  |      |
| As a user, If I press the wrong button, I need to be notified of my mistake and the pattern needs to repeat from the start. |      |   X  |      |      |
| As a user, I can see how many steps are in the pattern. |      |      |   X  |      |
| As a user, if I want to start over again I can press a button and the pattern will start at 1 over again. |      |      |      |   X  |
| As a user, when I get to step 20 and complete that pattern I will see message declaring me the winner and an option to start a new game. |      |      |      |   X  |
